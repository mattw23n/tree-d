## Notes
1. I used venv, but you can use global I guess
2. Have your own api key mofo, I paid for this shit
3. DO NOT try it using school internet when using the free account, your account will get flagged IMMEDIATELY and will be unable to call the api without upgrading thesubscription
4. You will need to install ffplay, use this command 

    *winget install ffmpeg*
